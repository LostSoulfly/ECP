ECP Bugs:
[+] Shutdown commands aren't sent encrypted even if the key isn't null
[+] Keep-alive packets aren't sent encrypted even if the key isn't null
[-] Closing the server before sending a {SHUTDOWN} command to the Client will cause the Client to go into an infinite loop and not shutdown
[-] Sending a broken handshake request such as "xxx{HANDSHAKE}" well break the tunnel forcing the user to send another handshake
[-] Sending a broken handshake reply such as "{HREPLY}" or "xxx{HREPLY}" or "{HREPLY}xxx" will break the tunnel requiring another handshake
[+] Sending a shutdown command from the client causes a loop if ECPClient.Disconnect() is called afterwards
[?] Client doesn't process text before initial shutdown command from server
[+] Packets from both server and client do not have any structure to them; they only have termination chars
[+] "Broadcast All" doesn't encrypt text with client keys

ECP New Features:
[-] All methods now have async versions
[-] Thread manager needs updating
[-] ECPUser objects need to be generated on connection; client names should auto-generate
[-] Constructors and other methods need overloading
[-] File Transfers

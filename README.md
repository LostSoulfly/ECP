A lightweight, flexible, and extensible network communcations protocol created with security in mind and focuses on the productivity of both potential clients and servers. ECP is built on top of multiple layers of security and is meant to be a base for anyone looking to implement networking into their own applications; ECP comes bundled with AES in CBC mode for general data encryption, SHA-256/512 for checksum generation and validation, and Diffie-Hellman as the key exchange algorithm.

# TODO
`TODO goes here...`

##### New Features
- [ ] All methods now have async versions
- [ ] Thread manager needs updating
- [ ] ECPUser objects need to be generated on connection; client names should auto-generate
- [ ] Constructors and other methods need overloading
- [ ] File Transfers

##### Bugs
- [x] Shutdown commands aren't sent encrypted even if the key isn't null
- [x] Keep-alive packets aren't sent encrypted even if the key isn't null
- [ ] Closing the server before sending a {SHUTDOWN} command to the Client will cause the Client to go into an infinite loop and not shutdown
- [ ] Sending a broken handshake request such as "xxx{HANDSHAKE}" well break the tunnel forcing the user to send another handshake
- [ ] Sending a broken handshake reply such as "{HREPLY}" or "xxx{HREPLY}" or "{HREPLY}xxx" will break the tunnel requiring another handshake
- [x] Sending a shutdown command from the client causes a loop if ECPClient.Disconnect() is called afterwards
- [ ] Client doesn't process text before initial shutdown command from server
- [x] Packets from both server and client do not have any structure to them; they only have termination chars
- [x] "Broadcast All" doesn't encrypt text with client keys
